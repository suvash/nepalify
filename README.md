# Nepalify

[![Build Status](https://github.com/suvash/nepalify/actions/workflows/.github/workflows/run-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/suvash/nepalify/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

A JavaScript library that adds support for typing Unicode Nepali(नेपाली) input on HTML `<input>` and `<textarea>` (using both traditional and romanized layouts).

## Supported Browsers

This library has been tested to work most modern browsers, the oldest ones being Internet Explorer 9, 10 and 11. If you are running an even older browser, you might want to look into the [legacy version](#legacy-version).

## Live Demo / Playground

## Installation

Nepalify is available in CommonJS2, ES6 as well as UMD formats for all different needs.  
It can be consumed directly via Unpkg CDN into your pages, or installed via NPM to include in your application bundle.

### Unpkg CDN installation

Via [Unpkg](https://unpkg.com/), you can directly use the bare url for the latest version.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/nepalify" />
```

Or, include the full fixed url.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/nepalify@0.5.0/umd/nepalify.production.min.js" />
```

Also, add an input/textarea element with a unique id, if you want to follow along.

```html
<input id="unique-input" />
<textarea id="unique-textarea"></textarea>
```

Optionally the following attributes can be used on the elements above.

```html
autocomplete="off" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="off" spellcheck="false"
```

### Via NPM

The library is available on NPM as `nepalify`.

```bash
npm install nepalify
```
Afterwards, you can use CommonJS imports
```javascript
const nepalify = require('nepalify');
```

Or, you can use ES6 imports
```javascript
import nepalify from "nepalify";
```

## Documentation

The default exports from the library consists of a handful of functions, as explained below.

### availableLayouts()

This method returns all available layouts, currently `romanized` and `traditional`. These layout names can be provided as options to other functions.

```javascript
console.log(nepalify.availableLayouts());
// ["romanized", "traditional"]
```

### interceptElementByID("unique-id")

This method allows the library code to intercept the keypress events on `<input>` and `<textarea>` html elements, given an `id` selector. This can only be used in a browser.

The argument to this function is the same as you'd provide to the standard `getElementById`

```javascript
var inputEl = nepalify.interceptElementById("unique-input-1");
var textareaEl = nepalify.interceptElementById("unique-textarea-1");

// Further options can be provided as a second argument
const options = {
  layout: "traditional",
  enable: false,
};
nepalify.interceptElementById("unique-input-2", options);

// When the options are not provided, the following defaults are used
const defaultOptions = {
  layout: "romanized",
  enable: true,
};
```

At this point, the library should already be intercepting the keypresses. Go ahead and give it a try.

The object returned by the function above has more methods that can be used to control the interception.

#### isEnabled()

Returns a boolean value indicating whether the interception is turned on or not.

#### enable()

Enable the interception on the element. Already done by default.

#### disable()

Disable the interception on the element. Useful for clean up or building toggle behaviour.


### format("some-ascii-text")

This method allows you to format the text to Unicode nepali. Also usable in Node or any other non-browser javascript code.

```javascript
var text = "kiMkr/tv/ybimuX/";
console.log(nepalify.format(text));
// किंकर्तव्यबिमुढ्

// Further options can be provided as a second argument
var text = "asdfghjkl";
const options = {
  layout: "traditional",
};
console.log(nepalify.format(text, options));
// बकमानजवपि

// When the options are not provided, the following defaults are used
const defaultOptions = {
  layout: "romanized",
};
```

## Development

While the library is intended to run in the browser, you'll need to have `node` (and `npm`) installed locally for development.

Most of the npm targets are explained in the `package.json` file itself. The following flow is preferred for contribution.

- `npm install` for installing all the dependencies.
- `npm run test` for running the test suite.
- `npm run dev` to run a local server, serves an html page with the library injected for manual testing.
- `npm run format` to format all the changes before making a PR.

## Legacy version

The legacy version of this package supported ancient browsers such as IE6, used jQuery as a dependency and relied on a bunch of hacks. It's still preserved on the [legacy-jquery branch](https://github.com/suvash/nepalify/tree/legacy-jquery)
